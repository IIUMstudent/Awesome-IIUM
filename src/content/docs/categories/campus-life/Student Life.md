A collection of community-sourced tips for surviving and thriving at IIUM.

## 💰 Saving Money

- **Bring Your Own Containers**: Bring your own food containers to the cafe to
  avoid extra charges (some Mahallahs charge for plastic containers).
- **Weekly Laundry**: Wash your own clothes or use self-service laundry once a
  week for maximum savings.
- **Drink Plain Water**: Avoid buying sugary drinks. Use the water dispensers
  (Coway/Cuckoo) available in each Mahallah.
- **SKP (Student Kitchen Project)**: Look out for free food distribution at the
  Mosque Foyer in the evenings (usually after 5:30 PM).
- **Walk to Class**: A great way to exercise and save money on transporters.
- **Rapid Student Card**: Apply for a concession card to get a 50% discount on
  all Rapid public transportation (Bus/LRT/MRT).

## 🏃 Health & Sustainability

- **Bathe Early**: Your body temperature can rise after a shower if done in a
  rush. Bathe earlier to let your body cool down naturally.
- **Health Preparedness**: Always keep a stock of basic medicine (Panadol, cold
  medicine, plasters) in your room.
- **Sun Protection**: During hot seasons, avoid direct sunlight and stay
  hydrated.

## 🚍 Transportation

- **Moovit/LRT App**: Use apps to monitor the schedules of Rapid KL buses
  entering the campus.
- **Transporters**: For late-night or urgent transport, check the community
  Telegram groups (Brothers/Sisters specific).
