## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to cultivate a community
environment rooted in **dignity, integrity, and mutual respect**. We are
committed to making this project a welcoming and safe experience for everyone,
regardless of background, identity, or level of experience.

We act with the understanding that our interactions should contribute to the
collective well-being and growth of the community, fostering an atmosphere of
trust and excellence.

## Our Standards

To maintain a high standard of conduct, we encourage behavior that includes:

- **Upholding Dignity:** Treating every individual with courtesy, compassion,
  and respect.
- **Acting with Integrity:** Being honest, responsible, and trustworthy in all
  contributions and interactions.
- **Constructive Engagement:** Sharing feedback with wisdom and receiving it
  with humility.
- **Community Welfare:** Prioritizing the common good and helping others succeed
  over personal gain.
- **Professionalism:** Maintaining decorum and avoiding speech or actions that
  could tarnish the reputation of the community.

## Unacceptable Behavior

We reject any behavior that harms the cohesion or safety of our community,
including:

- The use of sexualized language, imagery, or unwarranted advances.
- Trolling, insults, derogatory comments, or personal attacks.
- Public or private harassment or intimidation.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit consent.
- Any conduct that is dishonest, harmful, or disruptive to the professional
  environment.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards
and will take fair and appropriate corrective action in response to any behavior
that is deemed harmful, offensive, or inappropriate.

Leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, ensuring the
preservation of a healthy and productive environment.

individual is representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

reported by opening an issue at

reviewed promptly, fairly, and with strict confidentiality.
