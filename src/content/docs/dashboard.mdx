## 🛠️ About this Dashboard

This dashboard is automatically updated every 15 minutes using GitHub Actions.
It "pings" official IIUM servers to check if they are responding to requests.

> [!NOTE] This is an unofficial monitor and may not perfectly reflect internal
> network status. If a system is "OFFLINE", it means our external bot cannot
> reach it.
