## Overview

Awesome IIUM is a static site hosted on GitHub Pages. We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data. This policy explains what data we collect and why.

## Data We Collect

### 1. Analytics (GoatCounter)

We use GoatCounter, a privacy-friendly analytics tool.

- **No cookies** are used.
- **No personal profiles** are created.
- **No cross-site tracking** is performed.
- Data collected is **aggregated** (page views, referrers, device type).

GoatCounter privacy policy: <https://www.goatcounter.com/privacy>

### 2. Error Monitoring (Sentry) - Optional

Sentry is enabled only when maintainers configure a DSN in production. If enabled, Sentry may collect:

- JavaScript error messages and stack traces
- Browser and OS version
- Page URL where the error occurred

We do not intentionally collect personal data through Sentry. Source maps are used to improve debugging.

Sentry privacy policy: <https://sentry.io/privacy/>

### 3. Third-Party Services

Some components load third-party services:

- **Giscus** (GitHub Discussions comments)
- **GitHub API** (public repository data)
- **Aladhan API** (prayer times)

These services may log requests according to their own privacy policies.

---

## Local Storage

The site stores **non-personal** cache data in your browser (localStorage) to improve performance:

- Prayer times cache
- API response caches for dashboard widgets

You can clear this data at any time via your browser settings.

---

## Data Retention

- Analytics data is retained by GoatCounter per their default retention policy.
- Error logs (Sentry) are retained per Sentry account settings.
- LocalStorage data remains until cleared by the user.

---

## GDPR & Privacy Compliance

We follow privacy-first principles:

- No cookies
- No personal profiling
- No sale of user data
- Minimal data collection required for site stability

If you are in the EU or a region with similar privacy laws, you may request clarification or removal of any data via GitHub Issues.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as the site evolves. Changes will be documented in the repository history.
